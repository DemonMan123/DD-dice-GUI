Basic GUI for D&D. Includes Advantage/Disadvantage rolls, D20 roll, and an extra tarot card selection method which can be edited if you wish.

**Still very early development and work in progress**

*requires Python3.11*

(Also, this is my first time ever working with Tkinter, so I'm not quite fully familiar with it)
